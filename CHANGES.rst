----------------

- Support for Python 3.
  [thet]

- Reformat the codebase using black and isort to meet current coding guidelines.

  Default language is used when the site language is not available

0.2 (2014-11-03)
----------------

- A bunch of refactoring in order to add a new vocab type: TreeVocabulary.
  As the name suggests, treevocabulary supports
  ``zope.schema.interfaces.ITreeVocabulary``. It has better i18n-support using
  own i18n-domains for the caption and description of a term.
